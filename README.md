Principal component analysis (PCA)-
The following code takes input of any arbitrary SEM microstructure in .jpg format, and performs PCA on it. Additionally it generats a scree plot to 
map the fraction of variance of the original data to that post PCA with a selcted no of components.
Inputs required:No of components for reconstruction of the microstructure.

Aditionally a Results.pdf file can also be found which summarizes all the output and some furthur details and reconstruction performed on a particular microstructure.
